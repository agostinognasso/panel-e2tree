# STANDALONE PANEL E2TREE -- reproducibility source for the "Panel e2tree" paper.
#
# This file defines panel_e2tree() and its e2panel methods as a self-contained
# module. It is `source()`-d by code/paper_reproduce.R AFTER library(e2tree):
#
#     library(e2tree)
#     source("code/panel_e2tree.R")
#
# It depends ONLY on the EXPORTED e2tree primitives (e2tree, createDisMatrix,
# vimp, get_ensemble_predictions, plot_e2tree) plus CRAN packages (ranger or
# randomForest, dplyr, ggplot2). The panel method itself lives here -- it is not
# part of the public e2tree package -- so this repository ships the method
# without exposing the rest of the e2tree development source.
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# Panel E2Tree: explaining tree-ensemble structure on PANEL (longitudinal)
# data by decomposing the FEATURE REPRESENTATION into a BETWEEN (unit-mean)
# and a WITHIN (unit-demeaned) component, in the spirit of the Mundlak (1978)
# decomposition. One ensemble and one e2tree surrogate are grown per source of
# variation and the panel reconstruction is additive:
#
#     y_hat_it = between(mean of unit i) [+ time effect t] + within(deviation)
#
# WHY two representations (and not one model). On panel data with high
# intraclass correlation the between variance dominates: a single pooled
# explanation conflates "what distinguishes units" with "what moves them over
# time" and the within signal is crowded out. Decomposing the INPUT and
# explaining each part separately removes the competition between the two
# sources. The PERMANOVA decomposition of a pooled ensemble's proximity
# (the natural single-model alternative) does not recover the outcome's
# between/within structure, so the decomposition must act on the
# representation; see panel_e2tree() details.
#
# WHAT IS EXPLAINED. With target = "outcome" (default) panel_e2tree() is a
# modelling-and-explanation protocol: it refits one ensemble per
# representation and explains each. With target = "pooled" it explains a
# *given* pooled ensemble by decomposing that ensemble's predictions into
# between/within components and explaining each component.
#
# This module orchestrates the package primitives -- createDisMatrix(),
# e2tree(), predict.e2tree(), get_ensemble_predictions(), vimp() -- through
# the adapter layer, so it inherits multi-backend ensemble support. e2tree is
# an EXPLANATION method, not a predictor: component quality is fidelity to
# the ensemble it explains, cor(e2tree, ensemble)^2 computed against
# FULL-ENSEMBLE predictions.

#' Explainable Ensemble Tree for Panel (Longitudinal) Data
#'
#' `panel_e2tree()` explains tree-ensemble structure on **panel** (unit
#' \eqn{\times} time) data by decomposing the *feature representation* into
#' sources of variation, in the spirit of the Mundlak (1978) decomposition,
#' and growing a separate \code{\link{e2tree}} surrogate for each:
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{**between**}{unit means (one row per unit) -- what distinguishes the
#'     units, i.e. differences between unit averages;}
#'   \item{**within**}{unit-demeaned deviations -- what moves the outcome over
#'     time within a unit. With \code{within = "twoway"} the deviations are
#'     additionally purged of common period effects (two-way demeaning), so
#'     the within tree explains *idiosyncratic* movements and common shocks
#'     are reported separately as descriptive period effects.}
#' }
#'
#' The panel reconstruction is additive:
#' \deqn{\hat y_{it} = \mathrm{between}(\bar x_i) \;[+\; \hat\tau_t]\; +
#'   \mathrm{within}(\tilde x_{it}),}
#' where \eqn{\hat\tau_t} (period effects of the outcome) appears only under
#' \code{within = "twoway"}.
#'
#' @details
#' **What is explained.** With \code{target = "outcome"} (default) the
#' function is a *modelling-and-explanation protocol*: it fits one ensemble
#' per representation and explains each with an e2tree. With
#' \code{target = "pooled"} it explains a **given pooled ensemble**: the
#' pooled model's full-ensemble predictions \eqn{\hat f(x_{it})} replace the
#' outcome, are decomposed into between/within components, and each component
#' is explained. All reported metrics then quantify how faithfully the
#' decomposed explanation reproduces the *pooled model's behaviour*.
#'
#' **Why two representations.** On panel data with high intraclass correlation
#' (ICC) the between variance dominates: a single *pooled* e2tree conflates the
#' two sources and the within signal is crowded out, yielding low fidelity.
#' Single-model shortcuts (a pooled e2tree on raw features; a post-hoc PERMANOVA
#' decomposition of a pooled proximity; a single e2tree on Mundlak-augmented
#' features) were tested and discarded. Decomposing the *input* -- and
#' explaining each part with its own surrogate -- is what separates the two
#' sources.
#'
#' **What "within" is and is not.** The within representation is invariant to
#' permuting periods within a unit: it captures *what moves the outcome within
#' a unit*, not temporal ordering (lags, persistence). Common period shocks
#' are part of the within variation under \code{within = "unit"} and are
#' removed (and reported as period effects) under \code{within = "twoway"}.
#'
#' **Interpretive, not predictive.** e2tree is an explanation method. Each
#' component's quality is its *fidelity* to the ensemble it explains,
#' \eqn{\mathrm{cor}(\text{e2tree}, \text{ensemble})^2}, computed against
#' full-ensemble predictions. The returned \code{outcome_var_recovered} and
#' \code{r2_panel} quantify how much of the explanandum's variance the additive
#' reconstruction accounts for -- a descriptive diagnostic, never a predictive
#' claim about e2tree.
#'
#' **Feature-set dependence of the within component.** The within tree can only
#' be as good as the *within signal* of the features: with few time-varying
#' predictors it may degenerate. \code{panel_e2tree()} reports the mean
#' within-variance share of the features and warns when it is low.
#'
#' **Constant columns.** After within-demeaning, time-invariant features become
#' constant and are dropped from the within representation (e2tree errors on a
#' constant predictor); the same guard is applied to the between representation.
#' The tolerance is relative to each feature's original scale. Dropped features
#' are recorded and shown by \code{summary()}.
#'
#' **Missing data.** With \code{na.action = "listwise"} (default) rows with any
#' missing value are dropped first and unit means are computed on the complete
#' rows. With \code{na.action = "unit.available"} unit means are computed
#' per variable on all available observations (less biased in unbalanced
#' panels with missingness); fitting still uses complete rows. Note that
#' listwise deletion can materially change the panel's ICC -- compare
#' \code{$icc} across the two settings.
#'
#' **Scope.** This version supports **regression** outcomes only. The
#' between component generalises naturally to classification (unit proportions),
#' but a "within deviation" of a categorical target is an open direction; a
#' factor outcome therefore raises an error. Predictors must be numeric (the
#' between/within decomposition is defined on numeric features).
#'
#' @param formula A model formula \code{y ~ x1 + x2 + ...} (no interaction
#'   terms). \code{y ~ .} expands to every column except \code{unit} and
#'   \code{time}.
#' @param data A \code{data.frame} in long panel format.
#' @param unit Character. Name of the unit (group id) column, e.g. country.
#' @param time Character or \code{NULL}. Name of the time column. Required for
#'   \code{within = "twoway"}; otherwise used to check for duplicated
#'   (unit, time) rows and to annotate predictions.
#' @param engine Character. Ensemble backend fitted internally on each derived
#'   representation: \code{"ranger"} (default, fast) or \code{"randomForest"}.
#' @param ntree Integer. Number of trees per ensemble. Default \code{500}.
#' @param setting_between,setting_within Lists of e2tree stopping rules
#'   (\code{impTotal}, \code{maxDec}, \code{n}, \code{level}, optionally
#'   \code{max_thresholds}) for the between and within surrogate, respectively.
#'   See \code{\link{e2tree}}.
#' @param target \code{"outcome"} (default) explains the outcome's panel
#'   structure (refit protocol); \code{"pooled"} explains a pooled ensemble's
#'   predictions (see Details).
#' @param within \code{"unit"} (default) demeans by unit; \code{"twoway"}
#'   additionally removes common period effects (requires \code{time}).
#' @param na.action \code{"listwise"} (default) or \code{"unit.available"};
#'   see Details.
#' @param min_periods Integer \eqn{\ge 1}. Units observed fewer than
#'   \code{min_periods} times (after row filtering) are excluded. Units with a
#'   single observation contribute all-zero rows to the within representation;
#'   their count is reported by \code{summary()}.
#' @param pooled_ensemble Optional. A fitted ensemble (any supported backend)
#'   to be explained when \code{target = "pooled"}; if \code{NULL}, a pooled
#'   ensemble is fitted internally with \code{engine}/\code{ntree}.
#' @param keep_D Logical. Keep the per-component dissimilarity matrices in the
#'   returned object (size \eqn{O(n^2)} each). Default \code{FALSE}.
#' @param keep_data Logical. Keep a copy of each derived representation in the
#'   returned object. Default \code{FALSE} (the e2tree objects already store
#'   what their methods need).
#' @param dis_args Named list of additional arguments passed to
#'   \code{\link{createDisMatrix}} (e.g. \code{parallel}, \code{chunk_size},
#'   \code{verbose}).
#' @param seed Optional integer for reproducible ensemble fits.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to the ensemble engine
#'   (\code{ranger::ranger} or \code{randomForest::randomForest}). The
#'   arguments \code{formula}, \code{data}, \code{ntree}, \code{num.trees} and
#'   \code{importance} are managed internally and cannot be overridden here.
